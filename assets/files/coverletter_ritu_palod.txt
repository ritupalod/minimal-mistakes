Dear Sir/Madam,

I found out about the opportunity via LinkedIn and would like to apply for the job as it matches closely to what I've been wanting to do in my professional career. I not only have the desired skills (Business, Finance, Data Analysis, Expert SQL and PeopleSoft Oracle CRM) for the job but also posses business, accounting, visualization and data warehousing experience which is beneficial in the long run for a company.

I am an Information Systems masters from Northeastern University with prior 6 years of extensive experience creating Business Intelligence solutions while working as Senior Business Intelligence Analyst. Proficient in SQL for complex data retrieval and Python/R for statistical data analysis to comprehend trends for business solutions on large datasets. Looking to leverage my knowledge and experience into a collaborative and responsible role in an organization.
